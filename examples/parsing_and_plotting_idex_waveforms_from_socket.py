"""Example of parsing and plotting IDEX data from a socket

This is basically a rudimentary quickview tool. It demonstrates how this library can be used, in conjunction with
other tools like matplotlib to parse, organize, and plot data coming through a socket. The low level packet parsing
is done based on the XTCE definition for IDEX but there is significant additional logic that parses and concatenates
the binary blob fields of the packets, which contain the science data arrays.

The packet definition used here is intended for IDEX, which is basically a rebuild of the idex instrument.
The data used here is IDEX data but the fields are parsed using IDEX naming conventions.

Note: This example requires the matplotlib library which is not part of the base dependency spec for space_packet_parser.
